        This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and
        vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just
        use one or the other
      </li>

        Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken,
        you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a
        budget-friendly shortcut.

        Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long
        will make them mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the
        end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed
        vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.
